## Project description

This website allows users to compare the carbon emissions associated with different forms of electricity generation within a variety of countries. Due to both the uneveness between the global north in south both in terms of the availability of data, and more importantly, the level of industrial development, most the countries with available data are countries from the industrially developed global north. 

## The website features the following: 

### Home page

The home page, pictured above, features a photo collage, built with css grid, exploring  our world at the energy crossroads. At the top is a navigation bar, always present on the page and built with Router, that brings the user back to the home page, to an "About" page, or to a "Countries List" page. The "About" page features a description of how the site works, while the "Countries List" displays a list of the countries where data can be found on carbon emissions.

Upon clicking on one of the countries in the list, the user is brought to an "Emissions" page for the country. Each page contains emissions data on the following types of electricity generation: 
<br>
-Natural Gas
<br>
-Biomass
<br>
-Coal
<br>
-Geothermal
<br>
-Hydro
<br>
-Nuclear
<br>
-Petroleum and other oil derivatives
<br>
-Solarvoltaic 
<br>
-Wind
<br>

At the top of the page, a bar graph displays the data for each form of energy generation, and a table is displayed below with a section for each form of energy generation. If no data exists for a specific form of energy generation, an appropriate message is displayed in the table and no information for that form is displayed on the graph.
